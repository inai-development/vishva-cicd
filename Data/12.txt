Here is a full Python code for a "Hello, World!" program:

```python
# This is a comment - anything after the "#" symbol is ignored by the interpreter

print("Hello, World!")  # This line prints "Hello, World!" to the console
```

If you want a more traditional "Hello, World!" program with a `main` function, here is an example:

```python
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code defines a `main` function that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly (i.e., not when it's imported as a module by another script).
