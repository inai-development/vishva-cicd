Use the correct language label (like python, html, dart) immediately after the opening triple backticks — for example: ```python. Do not leave the label blank or put it on the next line. Ensure the code block is syntactically correct and markdown renders properly."

The language label must be on the same line as the opening backticks (e.g., ```python, ```java). Do not place the language label on a new line. The correct format is: ```python\ncode\n```.
